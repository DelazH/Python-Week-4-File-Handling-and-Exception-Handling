Input and Output:

The program asks for the name of the input file to read and the output file to save the modified content.

File Reading:

The program uses open(input_filename, 'r') to read the content of the specified file.

If the file is not found, a FileNotFoundError will be caught and an error message is printed.

Content Modification:

The content is converted to uppercase as an example of modification. You can change this to any transformation you prefer.

File Writing:

After modification, the content is written to a new file using open(output_filename, 'w').

Error Handling:

The program handles two types of errors: FileNotFoundError for non-existent files and IOError for issues while reading or writing the file.
